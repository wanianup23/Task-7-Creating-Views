Creating Views

A View is a virtual table that shows data from one or more tables using a SELECT query.
It does not store data itself â€” it just stores the query definition.
Whenever you query the view, it runs the stored SQL and displays the result.

Type	Description
Simple View----------	--Based on a single table, no functions or groupings
Complex View---------	--Based on multiple tables, joins, or aggregate functions
Materialized View------	Physically stores data for faster performance
Force View	------------Created even if base tables do not exist
